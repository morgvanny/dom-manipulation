Variable Declarations:

var
let
const



3 Steps When Creating Variables:

1. Declaration
  - Declaring something to be a variable in the first place
2. Initialization
  - JavaScript assigns that variable a location in memory
3. Assignment
  - That variable is assigned to some particular value


var a;  (steps 1 and 2 happened)

a = 10 (step 3 happened)

var a; (steps 1 and 2 happened)
a = 7
console.log(a)
a = 10

console.log(a)


Function Declarations Vs Expressions

Declaration:
someName() //calling before declared is ok
function someName() {


}

starts with "function"
are hoisted

Expression
a() // calling before declared will error out
const a = function a(){

}

are not hoisted
